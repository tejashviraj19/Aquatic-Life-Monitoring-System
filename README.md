# 🌊 AQUATIC LIFE MONITORING SYSTEM

An embedded system project designed to monitor key water quality parameters using **Arduino Uno** and a set of environmental sensors.

---

## 🔧 What It Does

The system measures and displays the following crucial parameters affecting aquatic life:

- 📏 **pH Level** – Water acidity/alkalinity  
- 🌫️ **Turbidity** – Water clarity and suspended particles  
- 💧 **TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)** – Mineral and salt concentration  
- 🌡️ **Temperature** – Current water temperature

All data is displayed on an **LED screen** for easy observation.
